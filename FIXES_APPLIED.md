# Fixes Applied - Task Processing and Logging

## Date
2025-10-07

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Tasks Not Being Processed
**Problem:** Tasks were created in the database and enqueued in Redis, but never processed.

**Root Cause:** The worker process (`worker.py`) was not running. Railway was only starting the web server.

**Solution:**
- Modified `railway.json` to execute `start_railway.sh`
- Created `start_railway.sh` that starts both worker and web server
- Worker now runs in background while web server runs in foreground

### 2. Task Status Returns 404
**Problem:** When polling `GET /tasks/{task_id}`, the API returned "404 Task not found" even though the task existed.

**Investigation:** Added debug logging revealed tasks were being created successfully in Supabase. The 404 was likely due to:
1. Testing with wrong task ID
2. Database query issues (now logged)

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging to `get_task()` in Supabase service
- Added logging to task status endpoint
- Logs now show exactly what's being queried and returned

### 3. Lack of Visibility into System State
**Problem:** No way to see if worker was running or check queue status.

**Solution:**
- Added `/debug/queue` endpoint showing:
  - Redis connection status
  - Current queue length
  - Supabase connection status
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with detailed service status

## Files Modified

- Added detailed logging to `get_task()`
- Added logging for query results
- All errors now include stack traces (`exc_info=True`)

### 3. `app/services/redis_service.py`
- Added debug logging for queue operations
- Logs queue length when enqueueing
- Logs dequeue attempts and results
- Added explicit "no task available" message

### 4. `worker.py`
- Added startup banner with system info
- Added periodic heartbeat logging (every 100 seconds)
- Added detailed task processing logs
- Logs task receipt, data fetching, routing, and completion
- All errors include stack traces

### 5. `workers/processors.py`
- Added task data logging at start of processing
- Added status update confirmation logs
- Added exc_info to all error logs for full stack traces

### 6. `app/main.py`
- Added `/debug/queue` endpoint for system diagnostics
- Enhanced error logging

### 7. `railway.json`
- Changed startCommand to: `bash start_railway.sh`

### 8. `start_railway.sh` (NEW)
- Starts worker process in background
- Starts web server in foreground
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Creates necessary directories

### 9. `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Updated worker deployment instructions
- Added troubleshooting section for worker issues
- Added debug endpoint documentation

### 10. `LOGGING_AND_DEBUGGING.md` (NEW)
- Complete guide to logging system
- Debugging procedures
- Common issues and solutions
- Production monitoring recommendations

## Logging Levels Added

### INFO Level
- Task creation and status updates
- Task enqueuing/dequeuing
- Worker heartbeats
- Major processing steps
- Success/completion messages

### DEBUG Level
- Detailed query information
- Queue operation details
- Internal state information
- Data payloads (sanitized)

### WARNING Level
- Tasks not found
- Connection issues (non-fatal)
- Configuration issues

### ERROR Level
- Task processing failures
- Database operation failures
- Redis operation failures
- All errors include full stack traces

## New Debug Capabilities

### 1. Check if Worker is Running
Look for these log entries:
```
============================================================
Starting video processing worker...
Worker connections established successfully
Starting main processing loop...
```

### 2. Check Queue Status
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/debug/queue
```

### 3. Monitor Task Processing
Follow task through logs:
1. API: "Created task X with type caption"
2. API: "Task X enqueued"
3. Worker: "Task received from queue"
4. Worker: "Starting to process task X"
5. Processor: "[X] Starting caption task"
6. Processor: "[X] Caption task completed successfully"

### 4. Track Task Status
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/tasks/{task_id}
```
Now with detailed logging showing:
- "Fetching status for task X"
- "Task X found with status: queued"

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Deploy to Railway
The modified `railway.json` will automatically start both services.

### 2. Check Logs
Look for worker startup messages in Railway logs.

### 3. Create Test Task
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.railway.app/tasks/caption" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"video_url": "https://example.com/video.mp4", "model_size": "small"}'
```

### 4. Monitor Processing
- Check `/debug/queue` for queue length
- Check logs for worker activity
- Poll task status to see progression: queued → running → success

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Worker Starts Automatically**
   - Railway starts `start_railway.sh`
   - Worker process starts in background
   - Web server starts and accepts requests
   - Both services share same Redis and Supabase

2. **Tasks Are Processed**
   - Create task via API → task saved in Supabase
   - Task enqueued in Redis → queue length increases
   - Worker dequeues task → queue length decreases
   - Worker processes task → status updates to "running"
   - Task completes → status updates to "success" with video URL

3. **Full Visibility**
   - Every step is logged
   - Can track task from creation to completion
   - Can diagnose issues quickly
   - Can monitor queue health

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Modified `railway.json` with new start command
- [x] Created `start_railway.sh` startup script
- [x] Made startup script executable
- [x] Added comprehensive logging throughout application
- [x] Added `/debug/queue` diagnostic endpoint
- [x] Updated deployment documentation
- [x] Created debugging guide
- [x] Verified Python syntax (all files compile)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Commit and push changes
   - Railway will automatically redeploy
   - Check logs for worker startup

2. **Verify Worker Running**
   - Check Railway logs for worker messages
   - Call `/debug/queue` to verify connections
   - Monitor queue length

3. **Test Task Processing**
   - Create a test task
   - Monitor logs to see processing
   - Verify task completes successfully

4. **Monitor Production**
   - Watch queue length over time
   - Set up alerts for queue buildup
   - Monitor worker heartbeats
   - Track task success rates

## Summary

The core issue was a missing worker process. Tasks were being created and queued correctly, but no worker was running to process them. This has been fixed by:

1. Updating Railway deployment to start both worker and web server
2. Adding extensive logging to track every step of task processing
3. Adding diagnostic endpoints to check system health
4. Documenting the complete debugging process

The system now has full visibility into task processing and the worker will automatically start with the application.
